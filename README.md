#24/7

*Our group name is 24/7!*
-
*We created the website about our university where you can find out the latest news and add your own articles to site. For example, in case you lost your item, you can add it there or leave a feedback or comment for university that will help to delevop!*


*Pycharm, django, html, css, python3, js were used for our project.*
-
*Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.*

**- Sae Yeon Chung worked for the external appearance and created an account for the Django administration to upload and connect the first news with our website **

**- Nazbiyke Zholdoshmametova created the form for adding articles that works with the blue button called "Add an article" to upload new articles to the "News" section **

**- Abubakir Zhorobekov added the function for editing and deleting an article and also the whole article will show up when you click on any news **
