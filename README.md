***Our group name is 24/7!***

*We created the website about our university where you can find out the latest news and add your own articles to site. For example, in case you lost your item, you can add it there or leave a feedback or comment for university that will help to delevop!*

*Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.*
